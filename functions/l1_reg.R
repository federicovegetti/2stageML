# l1_reg() Applies reg_extr by group and returns a data frame with coefficients, standard errors, number of observations and fit statistics (for linear models only) for each group.

#' @param formula The formula of the regression model, written as \code{y ~ x_1 + x_2 + x_n}
#' @param data A data frame containing all the variables and the observations in all levels
#' @param group The name of the variable identifying the groups.
#' @param x_fact Indicates which independent variables are to be treated as factor variables. Default is \code{NULL}.
#' @param method Which type of regression to run, currently only \code{"linear"} (cor linear regression) and \code{"logit"} (for logistic regression on binary dependent variables) are allowed. Default is \code{"linear"}.
#' @param min_n Minimum number of observations allowed in order to fit the regression. Default it \code{20}.
#' @param min_ng Minimum number of observations within each level of factor variables. Default it \code{5}.
#' @param focal_var Variable for which estimate and standard errors should be returned. Only 3 options: "(Intercept)" for the level-1 intercept, "(all)" for the entire set of estimates and standard errors (this is the default behavior), or "var_name", where this represents the name of the level-1 variable for which we want to use the estimate as a DV in the second-stage equation.
#' @return A data frame with the coefficients, standard errors, number of observations and adjusted RSquare (for linear models only) for each group.
